I'm a postdoctoral researcher working with <a href="https://carpentries.org/" target="_blank">The Carpentries</a> and <a href="https://cyverse.org/" target="_blank">CyVerse</a> developing computational and quantitative educational resources for researchers. I'm a behavioral ecologist by trade, and I did my PhD in Ecology at UC Davis with Jay Rosenheim and Sebastian Schreiber. You can read more about my work, view some of my photography galleries, or check out my blog for scattered thoughts on R, ecology, and the NBA.
